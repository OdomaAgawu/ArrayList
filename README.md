# ArrayList

We will learn to use the ArrayList class to create ArrayList objects and use methods associated with them in order to perform certain tasks. We will use ArrayList objects in several examples and we will make a comparison between ArrayLists of integers versus, integer arrays (simple lists of inegers). We will then proceed to write code that uses ArrayList.
